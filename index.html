            James Monroe High School in Los Angeles, California, during which time he became an amateur radio
            operator.He was later enrolled at Los Angeles Pierce College and USC.For a time, he worked as a receptionist
            for Stephen S. Wise Temple.</p>

font-weight: 600;">At age 12, Mitnick used social engineering and dumpster diving to bypass the punch card system
            used in the Los Angeles bus system. After he convinced a bus driver to tell him where he could buy his own
            ticket punch for "a school project", he was able to ride any bus in the greater LA area using unused
            transfer slips he found in a dumpster next to the bus company garage. Social engineering later became his
            primary method of obtaining information, including usernames and passwords and modem phone numbers.<br>

            <br>Mitnick first gained unauthorized access to a computer network in 1979, at 16, when a friend gave him
            the
            phone number for the Ark, the computer system that Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) used for developing
            its RSTS/E operating system software. He broke into DEC's computer network and copied the company's
            software, a crime for which he was charged and convicted in 1988. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison
            followed by three years of supervised release. Near the end of his supervised release, Mitnick hacked into
            Pacific Bell voice mail computers. After a warrant was issued for his arrest, Mitnick fled, becoming a
            fugitive for two and a half years.<br>
